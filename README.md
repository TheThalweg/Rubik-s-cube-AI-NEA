Source code for my NEA project.

It is a Rubiks cube solver that takes in inputs as a cube net or scramble and then uses 3 different AIs to solve the cube. On two of the AIs you can perform move inputs and the program will dynamically recalculate the solution.

The program is complete with a 3D animated cube and a bunch of menus and other buttons.
