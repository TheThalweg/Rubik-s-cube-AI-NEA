# Rubik-s-cube-AI-version-1
Version one of my Rubik's cube AI NEA as of 12/08/2023.


a lot of things are unfinished, but as it
stands the program can render a cube using javafx3d
and solve it using either a decision tree
implementation of the Thistlethwaite algorithm
(≈32 moves) and a beginner methods implementation
(≈ 100 moves).
